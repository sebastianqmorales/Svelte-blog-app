This site is about creating a new space on the internet that values the equity and transparency of information.<br>
**Our mission is to disseminate and present information in an equitable and transparent way.**
<br>

**Transparent to us means:**

1. See through, no hidden doors or secret meetings or decisions.
2. Easy to understand, no crazy or complicated wording or complex UI/ UX.
3. Honest, disclaimers, bias presentation, systems to present information in an transparent and equitable way.

**Equitable to us means:**

1. Fair, freedom from bias or favoritism and being reasonable, exploring multiple perspectives.
2. Every user is a owner/ shareholder of their content/ data, content creators own their content and pricing.
3. Every user has a say, users have tools to describe content and their perspectives.

<br>
Our vision is to create a place where every perspective is heard and organized in an accesable way and to evolve the way we present information, to revolutionize the way we consume stories and how we understand differing perspectives.

We hope you join us on this mission we have set out for, we value everyones input and love every user. This blog is the first step towards our mission, it may be long but it will be worth it. Thank you for reading Cuatex.
