## Introduction

Data unions run the internet, users are incentivized to contribute higher quality data to earn more money. AI is more intelligent, using data that it has paid for, creating higher quality data. A new economic sector has opened to the public, data trading and selling. Users can now leverage their power of data curation against companies or organizations they do not agree with. The overall economy has grown due to nearly everyone earning from their data and use of internet platforms. Instead of "Big Brother" we now have a free and secure data market where people no longer have the concern of being censored or manipulated by internet platforms.

If this future sound intriguing, let me introduce you to Data Dignity. The concept that will unleash a new era of internet prosperity. To get deeper into this concept and how it will positively impact all internet users, we first need to understand what the current business models of the internet are.

## Current business models of the internet

The advertisement model is based on the sale of advertisements on the platform, Google is an example of the largest billboard space on the internet. The platform then needs to gain a large user base to sell the ads to. Google has been able to grab attention by creating useful services, like search and maps. The advertisement model is used to prevent the sale of services directly to the consumer, so that the user can access the platform for free. Another aspect of this model is the collection of user data, another reason why the services are free. The data that is collected is used to sell personalized ads and to create new AI models. AI models are built off of human data, the AI then learns relationships from the data and tries to replicate them. This model has been extremely popular on major platforms as it creates an attention center and allows the user to use if for free. In turn, the user is providing a node to advertise to and data to use for the platform's needs, the only incentive for the user to use the platform is the fact that it is free.

#### The consequences of advertisement model

As I mentioned above, the platform needs to gain a large user base, this is done in two ways: providing useful features like a social network or search and by grabbing attention. The greatest consequence of the advertisement model comes from grabbing attention. I like to call the advertisement model the attention model, because attention sells ads. Here is the flow chart of consequences stemming from the advertisement model:

    Advertisement model (a third party manipulates your page to sell you products and get an emotional reaction) → Incentivizes grabbing attention (also incentivizes making the application addicting) → Incentivizes extreme emotional reactions → Creates a contorted view of the world ⇾ Creates chaos when organizations instigate through algorithms that are present in ad models.

In another article, I will go into further reasoning and example of why these consequences are true. A simplistic example of these consequences being present on these platforms are "clickbait". Clickbait is designed to get a quick and extreme emotional reaction from the user, to make them click on the video or content. This has harmful repercussions like decorating user trust in creators and propagating twisted opinions.

## Data Dignity models

What is the solution to this problem? A concept called Data Dignity, dubbed by a man named Jaron Lanier. This concept is a business model one, but it can have a major impact on the UI of new companies embracing this model. The idea is that users own all the rights to their data. This allows them to sell, delete or move their data, in turn this will incentivize the creation of so-called "Data Unions". Data unions will represent thousands of people who are willing to sell their data. These data unions can have a tier system, each tier could be based on the quality of the users' data, the higher the tier the more you can earn from your data. These unions can be in any platform that has user data. This would also mean that the user would have to pay for the service. The payment would be a micropayment, anything from 1 cent to 10 cents, remaining accessible to most people. Another feature that could stem from this sort of business model is the removal of "algorithms", this would be the case because the algorithms wouldn't need to be present due to the removal of the attention model. Everything would be based of off value.

In creator platforms, like YouTube, users can pay the creator directly from 1 cent to 10 cents, and the platform takes a small percentage of each purchase. This would greatly boost the online economy, making it possible to earn reliable income from the platform. As well as being able to sell your data, increasing the overall market in both aspects.

#### The consequences of the Data Dignity model

1. User pays with micropayments
2. user has all rights to data and can sell the data for profit
3. increases the economic participants
4. model incentivizes value over attention

   Data dignity model (users own all their data and pay for content)⇾ Incentivizes value -⇾ Increases economic participants ⇾ A cycle that makes data more valuable because people are putting in better data because they are getting paid for it.

## Conclusion

The advertisement incentivizes attention, which creates a cycle of extremism and a warped world view. As well as leaving the user out of a potentially massive data economy and leaving the creator out of the income they could be earning with micropayments (1 cent to 10 cents). The solution is Data Dignity, users own all the right to their data. Incentivizing the implementation of micropayments, creating a larger internet economy, which will in turn create a larger economy in general. The future relies on the newest generation of internet companies and their user base. By informing yourself on different business models, we can collectively shape the way we participate on the internet and earn money from it.
